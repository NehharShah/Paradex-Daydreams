## Configuration

- The agent uses Groq's LLaMA 3 8B model for processing commands
- JWT tokens are automatically refreshed every 3 minutes
- By default, the agent connects to Paradex testnet. For mainnet usage, update the `paradexLogin` function in `index.ts`

## Security Notes

- Never commit your `.env` file
- Keep your private keys secure
- Test thoroughly on testnet before using on mainnet
